FaceForensics++ is a large-scale dataset and benchmark for detecting manipulated facial images and videos, commonly used in deepfake detection research. It provides a collection of real and manipulated videos with various manipulation methods applied, enabling training and evaluation of deepfake detection models.

In this project, the Xception model is used for image and video deepfake detection, which aligns with the type of data FaceForensics++ provides. Although the project does not directly include FaceForensics++ code, it likely uses models trained on or inspired by this dataset for detecting facial manipulations.

Key points about FaceForensics++:
- It contains manipulated videos created using different face manipulation techniques.
- It serves as a benchmark for evaluating deepfake detection algorithms.
- Models trained on FaceForensics++ learn to distinguish between authentic and manipulated facial content.

Relevant code in this project related to image/video deepfake detection:

- The Xception model is loaded from 'models/xception_model.h5' and used to predict if an image or video frame is a deepfake.
- Video deepfake detection is performed by extracting frames and applying the image deepfake detector on each frame.
- Grad-CAM heatmaps are generated to visualize model attention on images.

Example code snippets from app.py:

# Load Xception model for image/video deepfake detection
xception_model = load_model('models/xception_model.h5')

def detect_image_deepfake(image_path):
    img_data = preprocess_image(image_path)
    prediction = xception_model.predict(img_data)
    predicted_class = prediction[0].argmax()
    if predicted_class == 0:
        result = "Deepfake Detected"
    else:
        result = "Authentic Media"
    # Grad-CAM heatmap generation omitted for brevity
    return result, str(prediction), cam_path

def detect_video_deepfake(video_path):
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
    frame_count, deepfake_frames = 0, 0
    while cap.isOpened():
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break
        frame_count += 1
        frame_path = 'frame.jpg'
        cv2.imwrite(frame_path, frame)
        if detect_image_deepfake(frame_path) == "Deepfake Detected":
            deepfake_frames += 1
    cap.release()
    deepfake_ratio = deepfake_frames / frame_count
    return "Deepfake Detected" if deepfake_ratio > 0.5 else "Authentic Media"

This project uses models and techniques compatible with the FaceForensics++ dataset for detecting manipulated facial media.
